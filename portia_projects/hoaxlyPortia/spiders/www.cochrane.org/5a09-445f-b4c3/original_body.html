<b>Review question</b>
</p>
<p>We reviewed the evidence regarding the effect of additional ('adjunctive') steroid treatment in individuals with influenza infection.</p>
<p>
<b>Background</b>
</p>
<p>The majority of individuals with influenza have a fever, headache and a cough and get better without any specific treatment. However, a small proportion of people develop a more severe form of influenza, requiring admission to an <span class="lexicon-term" title="Meeting the needs of gravely ill patients with special medical facilities, services, and monitoring devices"><abbr title="Meeting the needs of gravely ill patients with special medical facilities, services, and monitoring devices">intensive care</abbr></span> unit in hospital. These patients are often prescribed steroids as part of their treatment, although the evidence that steroids are beneficial in these circumstances is controversial.</p>
<p>
<b>Study characteristics</b>
</p>
<p>We searched for studies comparing additional steroid treatment with no additional steroid treatment in individuals with influenza. This evidence is current to June 2015. We identified a total of 19 studies with 3459 individuals; none of them were clinical trials. The majority of studies investigated adults admitted to hospital with pandemic influenza in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>
<b>Key results</b>
</p>
<p>We did not find any relevant clinical trials on this topic. The evidence available from existing observational studies was of very low quality. We found that patients with influenza who received additional steroid treatment might have had a greater <span class="lexicon-term" title="A way of expressing the chance of an event taking place, expressed as the number of events divided by the total number of observations or people.

Hospital-acquired infection was the main 'side effect' related to steroid treatment that was reported in the included studies; all studies reported a greater <span class="lexicon-term" title="A way of expressing the chance of an event taking place, expressed as the number of events divided by the total number of observations or people.

However, it was not possible to be certain if patients with more severe influenza were selected to receive steroid treatment in the first place. Therefore, it is not possible to be certain whether additional steroid treatment in patients with influenza is truly harmful, or not. Clinical trials of additional steroids in the treatment of individuals with influenza are therefore warranted to clarify the situation. In the meantime, the use of steroids in influenza remains a clinical judgement call.</p> </div></div></div><div tabindex="7" class="required-fields group-abstract"><div class="field field-name-field-abstract-conclusion field-type-text-long field-label-above">
